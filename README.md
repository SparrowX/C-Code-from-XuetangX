# c-plus-plus-basic
This repository records my process of learning c++ on xuetangx.com.  
Start at 2018-8-21.

End at 2018-10-16, I learned a lot, while I am also throwing it, practise again and again is the only way to master the c++.

Starting to step into my favourite fields, just begin my graduate career, I was occupied with so many affairs, I will insist on it and best wishes to me!

Next goal: Data Structure by Chen Yue.
